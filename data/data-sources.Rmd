## `state-legislatures`

I downloaded these data from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6QWX7Q on 2018-07-29.

The raw data include three files, which I retain in the project files:

* The original data set: `data/raw/shor_mccarty_1993-2016_individual_legislator_data_May_2018_release_(Updated_July_2018).dta`. The filename originally had spaces. I replaced each space with an `_` to facilitate more robustness in computing.
* The latest codebook: `data/raw/shor mccarty state legislator data codebook may 2018-1.pdf`
* The orginal artile: `data/raw/shor and mccarty 2011 final apsr.pdf`

Dataverse suggested the following citation:
